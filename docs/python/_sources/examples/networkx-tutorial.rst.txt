NetworkX Tutorial
=================

In this tutorial we will take a look at ways of combining the analysis tools provided by NetworkX with the visualization capailities of AlgorithmX.

Simple Graph
------------

Let’s start by creating a simple NetworkX graph. We will use add_path to quickly add both nodes and edges.

.. jupyter-execute::

    import networkx as nx
    
    G = nx.Graph()
    
    nx.add_path(G, [1, 2, 3])
    nx.add_path(G, [4, 2, 5])
    
    print('Nodes:', G.nodes)
    print('Edges:', G.edges)

Now that we have all the data we need, we can create an AlgorithmX canvas to display our nodes and edges.

.. jupyter-execute::

    import algorithmx
    
    canvas = algorithmx.jupyter_canvas()
    
    canvas.nodes(G.nodes).add()
    canvas.edges(G.edges).add()
    
    canvas

So we have our simple graph, but we think it could look a little more interesting. Let’s define a custom style for our nodes, and also give each one a different color. We can take advantage of the fact that nearly any argument in AlgorithmX can be passed as a lambda function, making our code much more concise.

.. jupyter-execute::

    canvas = algorithmx.jupyter_canvas()
    
    node_style = {
        'shape': 'rect',
        'size': (20, 12)
    }
    node_colors = {1: 'red', 2: 'green', 3: 'blue', 4: 'orange', 5: 'purple'}
    
    canvas.nodes(G.nodes).add() \
        .set(node_style) \
        .color(lambda n: node_colors[n])
    
    canvas.edges(G.edges).add()
    
    canvas

Making the graph directed is easy - all we have to do is call G.to_directed(), and then tell AlgorithmX that the edges should be rendered with an arrow.

Weighted and Directed Graphs
To create a directed graph, all we need to do is use a NetworkX DiGraph, and tell AlgrithmX that edges should be rendered with an arrow.

.. jupyter-execute::

    G = nx.DiGraph()

    G.add_nodes_from([1, 2, 3])
    G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1)])

    canvas = algorithmx.jupyter_canvas()

    canvas.nodes(G.nodes).add()
    canvas.edges(G.edges).add().directed(True)

    canvas

To create wighted graph, we will first ensure that our NetworkX edges have a ‘weight’ attribute. Then, we will add a label to each edge displaying the attribute.

.. jupyter-execute::

    G = nx.Graph()
    
    G.add_nodes_from([1, 2, 3])
    G.add_weighted_edges_from([(1, 2, 0.4), (2, 3, 0.2), (3, 1, 0.3)])
    
    canvas = algorithmx.jupyter_canvas()
    
    canvas.nodes(G.nodes).add()
    canvas.edges(G.edges).add() \
        .label().add() \
            .text(lambda e: G.edges[e]['weight'])
    
    canvas

Finally, AlgorithmX provides a uility to simplify this process.

.. jupyter-execute::

    from algorithmx.networkx import add_graph
    
    G = nx.DiGraph()
    
    G.add_nodes_from([1, 2, 3])
    G.add_weighted_edges_from([(1, 2, 0.4), (2, 3, 0.2), (3, 1, 0.3)])
    
    canvas = algorithmx.jupyter_canvas()
    
    add_graph(canvas, G)

Random Graph
------------

NetworkX provides a range of functions for generating graphs. For generating a random graph, we will use the basic gnp_random_graph function. By providing a seed, we can ensure that we get the same graph every time (otherwise there is no guarantee of it being connected!).

.. jupyter-execute::

    G = nx.gnp_random_graph(10, 0.3, 138)
    
    canvas = algorithmx.jupyter_canvas()
    canvas.nodes(G.nodes).add()
    canvas.edges(G.edges).add()
    
    canvas

To make the graph directed, we will simply use G.to_directed. To make the graph weighted, we will need to configure a weight attribute for each edge. Since our graph is random, we’ll make our edge weights random as well. For this we will use the set_edge_attributes function.

.. jupyter-execute::

    from random import randint
    
    G = G.to_directed()
    nx.set_edge_attributes(G, {e: {'weight': randint(1, 10)} for e in G.edges})

We can now display the graph using the utility from before.

.. jupyter-execute::

    canvas = algorithmx.jupyter_canvas()
    add_graph(canvas, G)

Detailed Graph
--------------

Now we are going to create a graph that displays a range of interesting properties. Let’s begin by generating a random weighted graph, as before.

.. jupyter-execute::

    G = nx.gnp_random_graph(10, 0.3, 201)
    nx.set_edge_attributes(G, {e: {'weight': randint(1, 10)} for e in G.edges})

Next, we will use NetworkX to calculate the graph’s coloring and edge centrality.

.. jupyter-execute::

    coloring = nx.greedy_color(G)
    centrality = nx.edge_betweenness_centrality(G, weight='weight', normalized=True)

We can now begin displaying the graph. First, we will add the nodes and assign them a color based on their calculated priority. We happen to know that any graph requires at most 4 different colors, and so we prepare these beforehand.

.. jupyter-execute::

    canvas = algorithmx.jupyter_canvas()
    
    color_priority = {0: 'red', 1: 'orange', 2: 'yellow', 3: 'green'}
    
    canvas.nodes(G.nodes).add() \
        .color(lambda n: color_priority[coloring[n]])
    
    print(coloring)

Afterwards, we will add the edges. Each one will have two labels; one to display it’s weight, and another to display it’s calculated centrality.

.. jupyter-execute::

    init_edges = canvas.edges(G.edges).add()
    
    formatted_centrality = {k: '{0:.2f}'.format(v) for k, v in centrality.items()}
    
    init_edges.label().add() \
        .text(lambda e: G.edges[e]['weight']) \
    
    init_edges.label('centrality').add() \
        .color('blue') \
        .text(lambda e: formatted_centrality[e])
    
    print(formatted_centrality)

Finally, we can see the whole graph.

.. jupyter-execute::

    canvas
